# react-layout-pack
React component for "packing" elements together in a pinterest-like layout.

## Demos
See [the demo page](http://rexxars.github.io/react-layout-pack/).

## Installation
`react-layout-pack` can be installed using [npm](https://npmjs.org/):

```
npm install react-layout-pack
```

## Basic usage

```javascript
var React = require('react');
var ReactDom = require('react-dom');
var PackLayout = require('react-layout-pack');

// Render the component
ReactDom.render(
    <PackLayout tag="ul" className="packed-layout">
        <li>One element</li>
        <li>Another element</li>
        <li>A third element</li>
        <li>A fourth element</li>
        <li>A fifth element</li>
    </PackLayout>,
    document.getElementById('some-root-node')
);
```

Properties:
```
{
    // The root-level DOM node tag, defaults to 'ul'
    tag: React.PropTypes.string,

    // The width of each column, in pixels. If not set, will use width of first child
    columnWidth: PropTypes.number,

    // Margin between each item, in pixels. Defaults to 10.
    itemMargin: PropTypes.number,

    // Whether to automatically reposition elements when the window is resized. Defaults to true.
    repositionOnResize: PropTypes.bool,

    // How often the repositioning should be performed while the browser is being resized. Defaults to 250ms.
    resizeThrottleTimeout: PropTypes.number
}
```

## Important notes

* This is a component in early development, and probably should not be used in production yet. The API will change in the future.
* Child elements that changes size after render won't work as expected. The component needs access to the height of each element to properly align elements. Images without a defined size will for instance break.
* It does not do things in "the react way" - styles are set explicitly on child elements through the browsers DOM API, which is bad.
